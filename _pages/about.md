Now I am a Senior Application Developer. Currently working in Advanced Apps Bangladesh Ltd as Team Lead. But I'm also interested to learn other exciting technologies. I started Android because it  is exciting and has a really enthusiastic developer community. A little more than five years ago, I started learning about it because I wanted to build something that is future oriented and easily accessible. Since then I have been developing mobile apps privately (see https://github.com/MahbubMunna) and have been continually teaching myself about it. 

My passion for programming started while I started to explore the tech. That time I was in class XI. I found it so exciting that I decided to go through an intensive study period and aim to go to the path of software engineering.

During my undergrad, I worked on several mobile apps. Here I was able to gain a deeper knowledge of Android development and was able to directly contribute to building a vast software engineering knowledge base on my own. My self-taught skills and drive convinced me to dream for great things.

After graduation, I pushed myself to learn industry best practices and more efficient software engineering called clean coding built by Uncle Bob.
